## Question

How to use existing controlled vocabulary, taxonomy or thesaurus with Confluence?

## Original question

How do I link Confluence labels to a centralized taxonomy OR create a shared taxonomy?
Can I use my own controlled vocabulary for labels in confluence?

## Answer

Labels may be suitable in situations where terms evolve quickly, and you are happy to live with the resulting folksonomy.
