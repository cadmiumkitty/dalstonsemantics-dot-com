In cases where several user groups use different terms to describe the same concept, adopt controlled vocabulary, taxonomy or thesaurus that includes preferred and alternative labels, and identifiers such as product or industry classification codes. Integrate them with Confluence using [Taxonomies for Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1226218/taxonomies-for-confluence) add-on. Insert concepts into Confluence pages and blog posts to make them searchable by preferred and alternative labels and the identifier.

* Start with creating or adopting existing controlled vocabularies, taxonomies or thesauri using [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/). 
* Specify preferred label (`skos:prefLabel`), alternative labels (`skos:altLabel`), and, if needed, common identifiers (`skos:notation`).
* Install [Taxonomies for Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1226218/taxonomies-for-confluence) add-on.
* Insert related concepts into Confluence pages or blog posts with Related Concept macro - search for Related Concept macro to insert, search for a concept using its preferred or alternative label or the identifier, select the appropriate one and click Insert. 
* You can now find Confluence content by preferred and alternative labels and the identifier.
