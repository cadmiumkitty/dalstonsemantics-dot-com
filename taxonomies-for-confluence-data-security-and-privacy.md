Last updated: September 24, 2021

Dalston Semantics Ltd ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Taxonomies for Confluence website at https://tfc.dalstonsemantics.com (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, disclosure and safeguarding of data when you use the Service.

## Data Collection And Use

### Personal Data

We do not collect or store any Personal Data when you use the Service.

Audit capabilities in the Service are implemented by storing the Atlassian accountID of the user along with the details of the user action (such as uploading a taxonomy or indexing a Confluence page). To display action history, user details are retrieved from Atlassian, although may be cached in memory by the Service temporarily to improve performance.

Since we do not collect any Personal Data, we do not share it with third parties.

### User Content

We use metadata such as characteristics and the number of taxonomies that you upload to improve the Service.

### Automatically Logged Data

The Service collects IP address, date, time, type, size, page address and time it took to process the request, as well as code and size of the response. We use this data to diagnose issues and improve the Service. 

## Security

We use Microsoft Azure to deliver the Service with Microsoft responsible for securing physical datacenter, network and hosts. For more information on Microsoft Azure see https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/compliance/compliance-overview

The Service is using industry-standard encryption to secure data at rest and HTTPS and TLS to secure communication with clients.

## Changes To This Security and Privacy Statement

We may update our Security and Privacy Statement from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Security and Privacy Statement on this page.

You are advised to review this Security and Privacy Statement periodically for any changes. Changes to this Security and Privacy Statement are effective when they are posted on this page.
